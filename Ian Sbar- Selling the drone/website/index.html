     <h1>Lesson Learned</h1>
     <p>I learned that I should communicate more in my group. Many of us were confused on our assignments and what our job was 
         in making the drone. This led to a few late assignments and some mistakes in making the drone. This is why we were forced to 
         use a phone as a place holder for the thermal camera, as we didn't know who was in charge of getting the camera until it was too late.
